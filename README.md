New York City, a global tourism hub, attracts millions of visitors yearly, making short-term rentals a significant part of its accommodation landscape. Airbnb, as a leading platform, offers a diverse range of lodging options, from shared rooms to luxury apartments. Understanding the dynamics of Airbnb listings—such as pricing, availability, and guest preferences—can provide valuable insights into the city’s rental market and traveler behavior.

This project analyzes Airbnb data from the Inside Airbnb portal, focusing on trends in pricing, occupancy, and property distribution across NYC's boroughs. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, it uncovers key patterns in how Airbnb operates within the city. The findings can help hosts, policymakers, and researchers better understand short-term rental trends and their impact on urban housing.
